    <h2> SGML </h2>
    <p>  SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is a standard for how to specify a document markup language or tag set. Such a specification is itself a document type definition (DTD). SGML is not in itself a document language, but a description of how to specify one. It is metadata. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> SGML is based on the principle that documents have structural and other elements that can be explained without reference to how such elements should be displayed. The actual display of such file may change, depending on the output media and style preferences.
    </p>
     <p>
      The language that this Web sites use, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), is an example of an SGML-based. There is a definition for HTML. In today's networking ecosystem, many documents are being described with the Extensible Markup Language (XML) which is a data description language that uses SGML principles.
    </p>
      <h3>Some advantages of documents based on SGML are: </h3>
    <ol>
         <li>These are made in terms of document structure rather than appearance characteristics.</li>
         <li>They will be more portable because an SGML compiler can understnad any document by its document type definition .</li>
         <li>Documents originally used for the print media can be re-used for other media, such as the computer display screen.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h3>Some disadvantages of documents based on SGML are: </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Linking is complex </li>
        <li> writing SGML is very hard </li>
      </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
      SGML is based on earlier general markup languages developed by IBM.

        <li>In this family of markup languages, Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is the parent.</li>
        <li>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a child, or application, of SGML.</li>
        <li>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a cousin to HTML and a nephew to SGML.</li>

      <h2> XML </h2>
  <p>
    Extensible Markup Language is used to describe data. The XML standard is a flexible way to create information formats and electronically share structured data via the public Internet, as well as via corporate networks.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    XML data is known as self-defining, meaning that the structure of the data is stored with the data, so when data comes there is no need for a pre-made structure for it, it is understood within the XML. The XML format can be used by any individual who wants to share content in a specific way. XML is actually a simpler and easier-to-use subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Applications for XML are endless. For example, computer makers might agree upon a standard or common way to describe the information about a computer product (processor speed, memory size, and so forth) and then describe the product information format with XML code. Such a standard way of describing data would enable a user to send an intelligent agent (a program) to each computer maker's Web site, gather data, and then make a valid comparison.

  <h3> Some advantages of XML are: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> it is easier to read as it is text based </li>
    <li>it is platform independent </li>
    <li> it makes business documents compatible with browser </li>
  </ul>
     <br>
  <h3> Some disadvantages of XML are: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> file sizes are very large. </li>
      <li> user needs to rewrite API </li>
      <li> XML requires separate XML stylesheet to use it for more than basic display of data. </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
  <dl>
  <dt>SGML</dt>
  <dd>Standard Generalized Markup Language, an international standard for defining methods of encoding electronic texts to describe layout, structure, syntax, etc., which can then be used for analysis or to display the text in any desired format.</dd>
  <dt>XML</dt>
  <dd>XML is a file extension for an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file format used to create common information formats and share both the format and the data on the World Wide Web, intranets, and elsewhere using standard ASCII text. XML is similar to HTML</dd>
